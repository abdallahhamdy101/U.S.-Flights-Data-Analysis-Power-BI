## U.S. Flights Data Analysis 🛫
### Project Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of airline and airport operations for US flights in 2015, based on data sourced from Kaggle. 
The project encompasses a full lifecycle of data handling from extraction through visualization, focusing on 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights records.

### Process Details :
#### Data Extraction 🔄:

Utilized a Python script to automatically extract data, ensuring the ability to refresh data for up-to-date analysis.

The script manages extensive datasets involving flight operations. 🐍

#### Data Transformation and Cleaning ✨:

Applied rigorous cleaning processes to enhance data quality by addressing missing values and duplicates.

Transformed data for analysis suitability, adjusting timestamps, and categorizing reasons for cancellations.

#### Data Loading 📥:

Efficiently loaded the prepared data into an analytics database, facilitating comprehensive analysis.

#### Data Modeling 📊:

Created a star schema to facilitate effective querying and data aggregation necessary for the analysis.
#### Data Analysis 🔍:

Analyzed 5.82 million rows across 40 fields to determine flight volume variations, departure delay percentages and durations, causes of cancellations, and airline reliability.
#### Reporting and Visualization 📈:

Developed intuitive dashboards and visual representations, using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to clearly illustrate trends and outliers in flight operations.
#### Analysis :
Flight Volume Variations: Analysis of how overall flight volume varies by month and day of the week.

Departure Delays: Examination of what percentage of flights experienced a departure delay in 2015, including the average delay time in minutes.

Seasonal Delay Patterns: Insights into how the percentage of delayed flights varies throughout the year, with a specific focus on flights leaving from Boston (BOS).

Flight Cancellations: Metrics on how many flights were cancelled in 2015, including the percentage due to weather versus airline/carrier issues.

Airline Reliability: Evaluation of which airlines are the most and least reliable in terms of on-time departures.

#### Key Insights 🌟
Airline Dashboard: Offers a comparative analysis of airline operations, highlighting cancellations and delays.

Airport Dashboard: Showcases performance metrics by airport, with a focus on operational challenges.

Delay Time Dashboard: Provides a detailed view of delay metrics to identify operational inefficiencies across airlines.
